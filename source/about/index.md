👋 Hi! I’m **Lucas Palminio**, a Computer Science Engineer from southern Chile, currently based in Temuco. I love creating solutions with technology: from websites and cloud tools to scripts that automate repetitive tasks ⚙️. I’m also interested in cybersecurity 🔐 and Linux system administration 🐧.

During my studies, I worked on real-world projects with impact. At **IDEAUFRO**, I participated in the development of web platforms using **VueJS**, **NodeJS**, and **Docker**. Later, at **Morris & Opazo**, I developed a customizable widget to integrate a chatbot into websites. In that context, I created a **master test plan following the IEEE 829 standard**, ensuring compatibility and performance across different browsers and devices 🧪.

Additionally, I was a teaching assistant for courses like Operating Systems and Programming during my time at university, which allowed me to reinforce what I learned and share it with other students 👨‍🏫.

I enjoy learning independently 📚. In my free time, I write on my [blog](https://palminio.cl), experiment with electronics 🔌, and explore topics like open-source software, web development, and amateur radio 📻. I’m a licensed amateur radio operator in Chile, [**CA6PUH**](https://www.qrz.com/db/CA6PUH), and you might sometimes find me on the air!
