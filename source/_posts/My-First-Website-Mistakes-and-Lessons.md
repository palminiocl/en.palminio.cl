## Introduction: The desire to have my own space on the internet 🌐

I always wanted to have a space on the internet that was *mine*, like a kind of digital home 🛖 (my [ruca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruca) for those who know), where I could show who I am, what I do, and what I know. A simple, functional page where I could share my portfolio and experiences. But like many who start in this world, I had no idea where to begin, what tools to use, or what I was getting myself into.

This is the story of how I went from impulsively buying my first domain to having a fully functional website without paying for hosting and with a personalized professional email. Along the way, I made wrong decisions but also discovered free tools that saved me time, money, and frustration. If you're thinking about creating your digital presence or if you've already started and feel a bit lost, maybe this will help you avoid my mistakes. 🚀

## 1. The first attempt: lucaspalminio.cl and the reality check 💥

It was October 2021 when I decided to buy my first domain: **lucaspalminio.cl**. It cost me CLP $9,950, a fairly common price at the time. I was eager to apply what I had learned in networking classes, and the idea of having my own site with my name seemed fantastic. The excitement of seeing my name with a ".cl" was indescribable. 😍

But there was a small detail: **I knew absolutely nothing about DNS or how to connect that domain to GitHub Pages**. I thought it was just a matter of putting the URL somewhere, clicking "save," and done. Spoiler: it wasn't. 😅

At that moment, I discovered that NIC Chile, the organization that sells ".cl" domains, does not offer complete DNS services. That is, you can buy the domain, but **you cannot manage A, CNAME, or MX records directly as you would with other services**.

> 🧠 *DNS (Domain Name System): The system that translates domain names (like palminio.cl) into IP addresses, which are like the coordinates browsers use to find your website.*

What I wanted was to connect my GitHub Pages repository to the domain I had purchased. But without access to a DNS service that allowed me to modify those records, the only option was a temporary and ugly redirection that didn't serve my purpose.

Frustrated, I didn't understand why it wasn't working. **I didn't know the difference between a domain registrar and a DNS service provider**, and that lack of knowledge cost me time, energy… and more money. 💸

> 🧠 *Registrar: The company where you buy your domain. They don't always offer DNS services. Example: NIC Chile.*

## 2. The impulse of the second domain: lucaspalminio.com 🌍
![lucaspalminio.com, my first site with a custom domain and space to experiment.](img/My-First-Website-Mistakes-and-Lessons/lucaspalminio.com.png)

After mentally wrestling with NIC Chile, I made an impulsive decision: to buy another domain, this time outside of Chile. I thought maybe it was a problem with the ".cl" extension and that if I bought a ".com," things would be easier.

That's how I discovered **Porkbun**, a cheap, user-friendly registrar with a pretty clear interface. I bought **lucaspalminio.com** for just USD $9.13, which at the time was about CLP $7,650. To my surprise, it was even cheaper than the Chilean domain. 🎉

The best part was that Porkbun not only sold the domain but also **included free services like:**

- Full DNS (you can modify A, CNAME, MX records, etc.) 🛠️
- URL redirection 🔗
- Email forwarding 📧

At that time, I didn't fully understand what all that was for, but I did know that I could **do what NIC Chile hadn't allowed me to do**: point my domain directly to my site on GitHub Pages.

It was like opening a new toolbox 🧰, and now I was able to successfully launch my site. I was so happy that I let lucaspalminio.cl expire without a second thought. I didn't even renew it the following year.

## 3. Three years of keeping a domain without direction ⏳

For the next three years, I kept lucaspalminio.com more out of affection than utility. I used it as a personal lab: one day I connected a Minecraft server 🎮, another day I tested email redirections, or set up small test sites. But the main site, the one that should showcase my portfolio or projects, **was abandoned**.

In September 2024, prices went up. What I used to pay (USD $10.37) increased to USD $11.06. It wasn't much, but it made me think: is it worth continuing to pay for this if I don't even update it?

It was a moment of brutal honesty. I wasn't using the domain productively. I was paying annually for an experiment that wasn't giving me any return.

So I made another decision: **I let lucaspalminio.com expire in October**. No drama, no nostalgia. I just let it go. ✌️

## 4. The awakening: the need for a personal brand 💡

A couple of months later, reality hit: I was in my final year of Computer Engineering and had to start looking for a job. And what's one of the first things recruiters check nowadays? Exactly: your online presence. 👀

I needed to showcase my projects, skills, and experiences in a place that was mine. No limited profiles on platforms. I needed something personal that spoke for me.

That's when, while browsing YouTube, I found a video that opened my eyes: **it is possible to have a website with a custom domain without paying for hosting, using free tools** like GitHub Pages and external DNS services.

But not only that. I also discovered that it was possible to have a **professional email account with your custom domain**, for free. 💌

My mind exploded. 🤯

> 🧠 **GitHub Pages:** A free GitHub service for hosting static websites directly from a repository.

> 🧠 **Custom domain email account:** An email address that uses your own domain, like "you@yourdomain.com," and doesn't depend on Gmail or Yahoo.

## 5. The ultimate solution: palminio.cl and a free, professional system 🏆

Armed with new information, I decided to do things right from the start. Since .com domains had gone up in price and I wanted something with a local flavor, I bought a ".cl" domain again. This time it wasn't a whim; it was a strategic decision: **palminio.cl was born**.

I chose it because it sounds professional, is easy to remember, and would allow me to create emails like **lucas@palminio.cl**. I even thought about helping my family create their own pages using subdomains like **name.palminio.cl**.

I bought the domain again from NIC Chile for CLP $9,950, and this time I already knew how things worked:

- I set up **Cloudflare** as my DNS provider. 🌩️
- I published my site on **GitHub Pages**. 📂
- I used **Zoho Mail** to have a free email account with my domain. 📬

All without paying for hosting, without complications, and above all, with full control over my digital presence. 💪

> 🧠 **Cloudflare:** A company that offers free DNS services with advanced features like DDoS protection and speed optimization.

> 🧠 **Zoho Mail:** A professional email service that lets you use your custom domain and offers a free account.

## Conclusion: You don't need a lot of money, just the right tools and the will to learn 🛤️

Looking back, I realize that the entire journey—with its mistakes, lessons, and impulsive decisions—was necessary to truly understand how the world of websites and digital presence works. It's not just about having a pretty domain or a page with your name; it's about knowing how to use the right tools to build something that represents you, without being driven by the impulse to overspend.

Today, with **palminio.cl**, I have a fully functional site, with a professional email, without paying for hosting, and with a system I completely control. The key? Learning to manage DNS, using GitHub Pages, trusting quality free services like Cloudflare and Zoho Mail, and—above all—not giving up on the first try. 💡

If you're starting out or if you've already made one or two mistakes like I did, I assure you that you can learn along the way. The most important thing is to be curious, willing to research, and not afraid to make mistakes. 💪
